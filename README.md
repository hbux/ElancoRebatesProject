## Introduction
Elanco wants to explore the use of cloud-based cognitive services to complete text analysis on receipts to improve our customer experiences.

We believe this can be achieved by accelerating our rebates process, which today requires our customers to complete multiple forms incorporating details from multiple
receipts/products. 

## Task
Using Azure Cognitive Services, build a web-based application which represents the use of image-to-text to extract and display key details from product images and receipts.
Elanco will provide sample images of test receipts/products and weâ€™d like to see which useful data we can programmatically extract and display in a web interface to validate this approach to streamlining the customer experience.

## System Design and Flow
### Project Structure
* **ElancoUI:** Holds the user interface pages, user interface models and classes.
* **ElancoUI.Tests:** Holds the unit testing of the ElancoUI classes.
* **ElancoLibrary:** Holds the business logic of the application. Acts as a layer between the UI and Data Access.
* **ElancoLibrary.Tests:** Holds the unit testing and mocking of the ElancoLibrary classes.
* **ElancoLibrary.Functions:** Holds the Azure Functions used throughout the project.
* **ElancoData:** Holds the tables, stored procedures and data publisher for the products/offers. 
* **Documentation:** Holds the example receipts, products logos, UML diagrams and user interface mockups.

#### User Uploading Invoice and Analysis Flow Diagram
Below is a flow diagram for three different ways of analysing invoices.

</p>

1. The first iteration of design, the user uploads an image, this image is then stored within the Blazor Server app, which is then analyzed. This is the least secure method of invoice upload.
2. The second iteration of design, the user uploads an image which is then stored using Azure Blob containers to ensure the upload is safe, it is then downloaded for analysis.
3. The final iteration of design, this is using Azure Functions. The user uploads an image, this is then stored using Azure Blobs which triggers an Azure Function to analyse the new upload and store the analysed results within a table on Azure.

#### UML Rebate Offer Database Design
An offer has multiple details and multiple product logos.

### User Interface

**Form Page:** This is the UI for the rebate form.

</p>

## New Requirements and Requirement Changes

There have been new requirements added by the client. Essentially, the client wants every field on the rebate form
to be auto-filled. This can be achieved by adding a login/register functionality where a customer account contains 
additional details such as:
* First name and surname
* Email address
* Address
* Multiple pets

The client wants to replace the pet input field to an image of the customer's pet(s). Where the user can select an image of their pet.

#### UML User Account Database Design
An account can have multiple addresses and multiple pets.

#### User Interface Requirement Changes 
**Form Page Authenticated:** This is the UI for the rebate form that has been filled when logged in.

**Account Page:** This is the UI for an authenticated user's account page.
